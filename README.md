## Hi there 👋

I am Shashank More, a software engineer with a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology and collaborative success. 
Currently I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern University, offered by the Khoury College of Computer Science.

With around two years of hands-on experience at Apptmyz and as a free-lancer, I specialized in Mobile Development and Full-Stack Web Development.

* ⚡  I love bringing efficiency to things. I have a passion for solving problems, building sustainable solutions, and learning as much as I can about things that interest me. When I'm not working, I'm probably listening t       music, going on a road trip or playing lawn tennis and chess.
